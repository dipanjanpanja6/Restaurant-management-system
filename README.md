# to do

 - Customers can scan QR codes at their tables to access the restaurant's menu.
 - The system should display the menu items on the customer's device upon scanning the QR code.
  
1. Running Bill Display:
 - After scanning the QR code, customers should be able to view the running bill for their table.
 - The system should update the bill in real-time as items are added or removed by the staff.
  
1. Admin Page for Sales Tracking:
 - An admin page should be included to track the daily sales and item popularity.
  -The admin should be able to view which items have been sold and their corresponding quantities on a daily basis.
